# InstaCloneFirebase

In Atil Samancioglu's swift training course, I have learned how to clone Instagram. I created an InstaClone App. There is feed page, users can view what other users share and like that posts. Also there is upload and setting pages at tab bar controller.

In this project I have learned,

- how to work with Firebase
- how to use cocoapods 
- in terminal pod processes(initiating and installing pods)
- how to work with SDWebImage
- how to create Feed Cell

and so many other things.
